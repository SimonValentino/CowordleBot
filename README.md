Cowordle bot by Simon Valentino.

Just a fun webscraping project I thought would be cool to make.

The bot goes until it looses. You can customize the username and weather or not Cowordle is played on hard mode or not with the USERNAME and IS_HARD_MODE variables respectively. The defaults are "Simon101" for the username and the game is set to hard mode. The underlying bot that is playing is ELDROW. You can view the Eldrow bot website that is being scraped by commenting out the follwoing piece of code: options.add_argument("--headless").
